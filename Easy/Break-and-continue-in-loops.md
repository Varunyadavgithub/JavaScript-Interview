### **What is the purpose of the `break` and `continue` statements in JavaScript loops ?**

In JavaScript, the `break` and `continue` statements are used to control the flow of loops (`for`, `while`, and `do...while`). They provide mechanisms to exit or skip iterations based on specific conditions.

---

### **1. `break` Statement**
The `break` statement terminates the current loop immediately and exits the loop entirely. After the `break` statement is executed, the control flow moves to the statement following the loop.

#### **Use Case**:  
When you want to stop the loop once a specific condition is met.

##### **Syntax**:
```javascript
break;
```

##### **Example**:
```javascript
for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
  if (i === 3) {
    break; // Exit the loop when i equals 3
  }
  console.log(i);
}
// Output: 1, 2
```
In this example:
- The loop terminates completely when `i` is `3`.

---

### **2. `continue` Statement**
The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop. It does not terminate the loop, only the current iteration.

#### **Use Case**:  
When you want to skip specific iterations of a loop based on a condition.

##### **Syntax**:
```javascript
continue;
```

##### **Example**:
```javascript
for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
  if (i === 3) {
    continue; // Skip the iteration when i equals 3
  }
  console.log(i);
}
// Output: 1, 2, 4, 5
```
In this example:
- The loop skips the `console.log` statement when `i` equals `3` and continues with the next iteration.

### **Differences Between `break` and `continue`**
| Feature            | `break`                                      | `continue`                       |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Effect on Loop** | Terminates the loop entirely.               | Skips the current iteration.    |
| **Control Flow**   | Moves to the statement after the loop.      | Moves to the next iteration.    |
| **Usage**          | To exit the loop under certain conditions.  | To skip specific iterations.    |

---

### **Example: Using Both in a Single Loop**
```javascript
for (let i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
  if (i === 3) {
    continue; // Skip the iteration for i = 3
  }
  if (i === 7) {
    break; // Exit the loop completely when i = 7
  }
  console.log(i);
}
// Output: 1, 2, 4, 5, 6
```

### **Use Cases in Real-World Scenarios**

#### **`break` in a Search Operation**:
```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const target = 3;

for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
  if (numbers[i] === target) {
    console.log(`Found ${target} at index ${i}`);
    break; // Stop searching once the target is found
  }
}
```

#### **`continue` in Filtering Data**:
```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
for (let num of numbers) {
  if (num % 2 === 0) {
    continue; // Skip even numbers
  }
  console.log(num);
}
// Output: 1, 3, 5
```

### **Conclusion**
- The `break` statement is used to terminate a loop when a specific condition is met.
- The `continue` statement is used to skip certain iterations without stopping the entire loop.
- Both statements provide flexibility in controlling the flow of loops, making them essential tools for writing efficient and concise code in JavaScript.
